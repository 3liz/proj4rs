Binding to geodesic routines
============================

This is a static binding of the C implementation of geodesic
algorithms as implemented in the [Proj library](https://proj.org/en/stable/).

This crate is used as an optional dependency of the [proj4rs](https://lib.rs/crates/proj4rs)
and was created initially for the support of the [Azimuthal Equidistant (aeqd)](https://proj.org/en/stable/operations/projections/aeqd.html) projection.
