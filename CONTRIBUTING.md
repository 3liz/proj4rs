## Contributing

### Modify

Any Rust file you wish to modify can be found in `src/` with some tests in `tests/proj4js_tests.rs`.
In order to test your new code, you need to build it thanks to WASM. More information on how to build it can be found in [README_WASM.md](./README_WASM.md).

### Test

If you want to test your code, you can ron locally some demos by reading [this README](./ol-proj4rs-demo-app/README.md) in `ol-proj4rs-demo-app/`.
You can create another demo page with a HTML file + JavaScript file combo.
